## Organization
Instead of grouping things by CTF or year, let's group things by concept and topic.
Example:
- pwn
    - heap
        - tcache
    - kernel
        - ret2user

- rev
    - Virtual Machines
    - Packers
        - udp

- crypto
    - ECC 
    - RSA
        - small exponent attack

- misc
    - Stego

### Writeup Format
1. Have the solve script/files
2. Have a writeup
    - The writeup must have a `## Summary` that gives the jist of what happen.
        - Example: "Exploing a use-after-free in libc 2.31 using house of BotCake"
